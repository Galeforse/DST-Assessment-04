**Announcement:**

Our team used a dataset provided by the University of South-West Canberra, from the cybersecurity department of ADFA-NB15. The dataset was originally found [here](https://unsw.adfa.edu.au/unsw-canberra-cyber/cybersecurity/ADFA-NB15-Datasets/).

_However_ , as of 24.03.2021, the datasets are no longer accessible. This only became apparent as our team has just finished the project as a whole. The website is linked in a couple of places across our contributors' works, but, as explained, it unfortunately is no longer working.

Nonetheless, the datasets are still visible as we've externally downloaded them and then uploaded in our repository. They can all be found [here](https://github.com/Galeforse/DST-Assessment-04/tree/main/Data) - both pre and post-processed.

The initial datasets our team used from there were the ones annotated 'UNS1' through 'UNS4' in the folder linked above.

We apologize for the inconvenience!
