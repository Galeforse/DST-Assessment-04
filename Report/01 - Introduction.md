# Data Science Toolbox - Assessment 04

*This project is the 4th assessment for the Data Science Toolbox from the MSc Mathematics of Cybersecurity course at the University of Bristol (2020/21). There are 4 contributors to the project. While it is preferrable to be able to test models and draw solid conclusions, the most important parts of these assessments is to explore options available for good Data Science in the industry and learn new skills throughout the project.*

## Introduction

The reader is asked to look at each item in the [Report](https://github.com/Galeforse/DST-Assessment-03/tree/master/Report) folder in the designated number order to follow a similar sequence of events to how we conducted our code. However some code was shared amongst the group at the same time, and therefore several section will make reference to parts that feature later in the report.
